<div class="mySlides">
  <q>You are about to make the worst decision of your natural born life.
  It all starts with laziness. First you dont attend your classes. You start
  staying in your room and letting assignments go unfinished. Grades begin to
  slip and your parents begin to take notice. They threaten to kick you out of
  your house if you don't get it together. Professors and
  TAs frantically email you. You are on the brink of failing all of your courses.
  But none of this permeates your mind. Everyday that you continue to skip, you
  are more and more numb and indifferent to the situation.</q>
</div>


<div class="mySlides">
  <q>You have been dropped from all your courses. Your grades were beyond saving.
    You have been strongly encouraged to withdraw from your university. You
    have decided to drop out. Your parents stick to their word. They give you
    until the end of the week to get out of their house. No room for a deadbeat
    when there are your little siblings to raise. When you get back to your house
    Friday night all of your belongings are boxed up and sitting by the front door.
    Your parents don't help you load anything into your beat up old car. Off you
    go into the night, no idea where you are going to go. </q>
</div>

<div class="mySlides">
  <q>You end up sleeping in your car in a parking lot. You're terrified. You
  aren't able to determine if the people knocking on your window in the dark are
  in your dreams or if they're truly there. Your mind is so stressed and exhausted
  it can't differentiate between unconscious dreams and reality. If the people were
  real they definitely had something they wanted me to see. Their faces were
  indiscernible in the dark, but you could feel malice radiating from them.
  You vehemently ignored and disregarded the knocking while you were experiencing it,
  but once the sun rises you feel the need to seek them out later that night.
  They must have something for me, or at least something to say to make this
  entire situation okay. Entertaining these delusions was the worst choice you could
  have possibly made. </q>
</div>

<div class="mySlides">
  <q>The mission of the day was to keep yourself from sleeping that night, so you
  could meet these mystery figures. You scrounge loose change from within your car,
  stuck between the seats, scattered across the dirty floor and manage to buy
  a cup of gas station coffee in an attempt to keep awake. The length of the day
  felt intolerable to you, dying to know what was in store for you. Finally nightfall arrives
  and you sit in your car anxiously awaiting whoever would make an appearance.
  The small digital clock on the dashboard read 3:14 a.m. You start to think this figure
  may not return. Your eyes grow heavier and start to flutter closed. As soon as you think
  you are about to surrender to the exhaustion, the knock comes. The sound startles you awake and
  through the glass you see the dark figure. They gesture for you to get out of the car.
  You exit, not entirely sure why you're trusting this stranger, but you do. They're wearing a large
  black hooded sweater and their hands are in the central pocket. You begin to open your mouth to ask what they want,
  but they beat you to it. They pull out a baggie containing a powder, and you realize this is just a drug dealer.
  You consider your dwindling funds and debate whether or not you needed this. You consider your mental anguish and the turmoil of your life
  and decide there is not much left to lose. You hand over crumpled bills from your pocket and shakily accept the baggie. You have no idea what you
  have just done. You have no way of forseeing the person that you are going to become just to be able to use.
  </q>
</div>

<div class="mySlides">
  <q>Your face is sunken in. You haven't eaten in days. Not that you could afford that unnecessary expense. You've sold your car, you've begun
  to steal from stores and pickpocket whenever possible. You are so desperate to feed your habit. It's as if there is a cavernous maw within
  your mind that craves it constantly. It does not let up and it will not leave you alone until you use but even then, it is never quite enough.
  You say silent prayers to yourself everyday that your dealer makes their weekly appearance so you can simply make it through. You know this
  is no way to live but you don't feel like you know how to do anything else at this point. You have become so accustomed to hiding under bridges
  and within condemned buildings that you don't know how else to conduct yourself. You have been consumed by this way of life. You often
  try and think back to the decisions you made that have led you to this point. You wonder what would be different if you had applied yourself.
  You feel as though it is much too late to turn things around so you allow yourself to delve even further into this hellscape that has now become
  your life. </q>
  </div>

  <div class="mySlides">
    <q>Your feet are pounding the pavement so hard you feel like your fragile body is on the verge of collapse. You hear yelling behind you
      commanding you to stop and lie down. You refuse and keep running. Survival mode has kicked in and your body is doing all it can to keep itself
      going. You knew your real fear was being forced to detox in a jail cell and your body would not let that become a reality. Just when you think
      you have made it out, you are tackled to the ground. Your vision goes fuzzy around the edges until everything is black. When you come to you
      are in the back of a car. Your vision is still fuzzy but you can recognize that it is a cop car. Your heart sinks and your entrails go cold.
      You want to argue and plead and beg just so you have another chance to use again. You know they will take no pity on you. You go through hours
      of intake processing in jail all while withdrawal symptoms quickly start to settle in under your skin. When you're finally within the cell
      you're beginning to sweat profusely and your digestive system feels as though it wants to drop straight out of your body. Your heart has
      begun to palpitate wildly. Your body is in panic mode and it wants nothing more than relief but you have no way to alleviate this pain.
      A guard comes and looks into your cell as you are on the floor writhing. You are struggling to breathe and your vision is starting to fade.
      You need it. Your body is starting to die without it. Your breathing has all but halted. Trippy glorious shapes fill your mind behind your eyes
      and you feel your muscles begin to relax. You manage to gasp out your final thoughts which fall on totally unsympathetic ears. "What If."</q>
